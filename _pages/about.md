I am a PhD student at UW, in the Applied Mathematics department. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Aleksandr Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/) and [Prof. Zaid Harchaoui](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/zaid-harchaoui/main). I am currently a research intern at Meta FAIR, hosted by [Lin Xiao](https://linxiaolx.github.io/). Before starting the PhD studies, I completed a Master's degree in Applied & Computational Mathematics at UW. Prior to returning to academia, I worked in applied NLP at Microsoft for 5.5 years, most recently as a Senior Applied Researcher in Azure AI. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering at University of Michigan, where I also had the honor of being a Men's Varsity Wrestling student-athlete.

## Research Interests

I am interested in mathematical and computational methods for efficient deep learning:
- Stochastic Optimization methods for nonconvex problems
- High-Performance Computing for deep learning acceleration
- Applied Probability & Optimal Transport for robust learning
- Efficient Methods and Systems: integrating theory with tangible applications

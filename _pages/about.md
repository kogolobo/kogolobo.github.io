I am entering a PhD degree in UW Applied Mathematics department, starting September 2024. Before that, I am finishing a Master's degree in Applied & Computational Mathematics at UW. Prior to returning to academia, I worked in applied NLP at Microsoft for 5.5 years, most recently as a Senior Applied Researcher in AzureAI. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering at University of Michigan, where I also had the honor of being a Men's Varsity Wrestling student-athlete.

## Research Interests

I am interested in mathematical and computational methods for efficient deep learning:
- Stochastic Optimization methods for faster model convergence
- Numerical Analysis for accelerated matrix operations
- Applied Probability & Optimal Transport for robust learning
- Efficient Methods and Systems: integrating theory with tangible applications
